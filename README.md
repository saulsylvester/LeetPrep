# LeetPrep

LeetPrep: Practice the Blind 75 with automated testing and solution management. Focus on coding, not setup.

## Description

LeetPrep is a command-line tool designed to streamline your practice of the Blind 75 LeetCode questions. It automates testing, solution wiping, and sequential problem presentation, allowing you to focus on problem-solving and coding interview preparation.

## Features

* **Automated Testing:** Runs your solutions against predefined test cases.
* **Solution Wiping:** Automatically clears successful solutions, preparing you for the next problem.
* **Sequential Problem Presentation:** Guides you through the Blind 75 in the intended order.
* **Local Execution:** Runs entirely on your local machine, no external dependencies (beyond required language libraries).
* **Clear Problem Statements:** Integrates problem descriptions directly into the tool.
