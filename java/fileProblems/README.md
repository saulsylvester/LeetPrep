# Here's a **progressive learning path from easiest to hardest**, focusing on Java implementation. I’ve kept the problems grouped by concept but arranged so you can gradually build skills.

## **Step 1: Basic String & Array Manipulation**

These are foundational problems to get comfortable with string operations, arrays, and simple prefix matching.

1. **[Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)** — Easy
   *Prefix matching, a foundation for file search.*

2. **[String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)** — Medium
   *File compression logic practice.*

3. **[Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/)** — Medium
   *Learn string serialization/decompression patterns.*

---

## **Step 2: Basic Data Structures**

These introduce you to hash maps, stacks, and queues—core tools for managing files, ownership, and capacities.

4. **[Design HashMap](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/)** — Easy
   *Simulates file lookups by name.*

5. **[Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)** — Easy
   *Practice stack/queue operations relevant for processing file tasks.*

6. **[Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)** — Medium
   *Useful for prefix searches, like `find_file()`.*

7. **[Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)** — Medium
   *Prefix-based search with sorting.*

## **Step 3: File System Simulation**

These are closer to what you encountered with the cloud storage system—file storage, ownership, and path handling.

8. **[File System Paths / Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)** — Medium
   *Manipulating directories and file paths.*

9. **[Design In-Memory File System](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/)** — Hard
   *Full simulation of a file system, essential for Levels 1-3.*

10. **[Design a File Sharing System](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-file-sharing-system/)** — Medium
    *User management and file permissions.*

---

## **Step 4: Capacity & Resource Management**

These problems simulate capacity limits and efficient space allocation, directly related to `add_file_by()` and `update_capacity()`.

11. **[Bag of Tokens](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/)** — Medium
    *Managing resource usage and capacity.*

12. **[Reduce Array Size to The Half](https://leetcode.com/problems/reduce-array-size-to-the-half/)** — Medium
    *Compressing or removing items to meet constraints.*

13. **[Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)** — Medium
    *Resource allocation and feasibility checks.*

14. **[Design a Stack With Increment Operation](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-stack-with-increment-operation/)** — Medium
    *Dynamic updates to stored values.*

15. **[Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/)** — Medium
    *Optimizing capacity usage.*

---

## **Step 5: Cache & System Design (Advanced Storage Patterns)**

These help you manage eviction policies, concurrency, and large system behavior.

16. **[LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)** — Medium
    *Eviction strategies similar to removing files on capacity limits.*

17. **[LFU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/)** — Hard
    *Advanced eviction policies for storage management.*

18. **[Design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/)** — Medium
    *User-based storage and content management.*

19. **[Design Search Autocomplete System](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-search-autocomplete-system/)** — Hard
    *Efficient prefix search on large datasets.*

### ✅ Suggested Approach in Java

1. **Start with Step 1 & 2** to warm up with strings and simple data structures.
2. **Step 3** simulates the file system. Implement these in Java classes with `Map<String, Integer>` for file sizes and `Map<String, String>` for ownership.
3. **Step 4** gives practice in capacity management (add/remove files dynamically).
4. **Step 5** teaches you system design patterns, caching, and optimization strategies.
